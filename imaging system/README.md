#UAV Imaging System

##System Block Diagram

##System Components:
1- Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB RAM)
2- 12V-24V Buck Converter (Step down to 5V 5A)
3- Samsung Evo Plus 64GB (Booting disk)
4- Logitech USB Webcam (30 FPS)
5- Ublox-NEO-M8N GPS Positioning Module

##Overclocking and Performance
The Raspberry Pi 5 is overclocked from 2.4GHz to 2.7GHz to enhance performance. 
This allows the camera to reach 30 FPS by utilizing all four cores of the CPU. 
Additionally, the system uses a swap file on the booting disk to create virtual RAM, extending the RAM from 8GB to 16GB. 
This configuration supports real-time imaging and extensive data processing during runtime.

##Environment Setup
The environment is prepared using Miniforge to create a virtual environment and install the necessary libraries for OpenCV (computer vision library), TensorFlow, and Pynmea (GPS hardware library).

##System Workflow Explanation
The system involves initializing the GPS module, reading GPS data, and recording video with embedded GPS information. 
The main script (sys_run.sh) coordinates these tasks, ensuring that the processes run concurrently. 

Hereâ€™s an explanation of each script and the overall workflow:

{sys_run.sh}
>>This script initializes the system and starts the necessary processes.
1- The script clears the terminal and prints initialization messages.
2- It starts the start_gps.sh script to begin reading GPS data.
3- After a short delay, it starts the vid_gps.py script to begin video recording.

{start_gps.sh}
This script continuously reads GPS data from the GPS module and writes it to a temporary file.
1- The script sets the necessary permissions for accessing the GPS module.
2- It continuously reads GPS data from /dev/ttyAMA0 and writes it to /tmp/gps_data.txt.
3- The loop ensures that the script keeps running, updating the GPS data file every second.

{vid_gps.py}
>>This script records video from the webcam and overlays GPS information on the video frames.

1- The (read_gps) function continuously reads GPS data from the temporary file and sends the parsed coordinates through a pipe to the record_video function.
2- The (record_video) function captures video from the webcam, overlays the FPS and GPS coordinates on the video frames, and saves the video to a temporary file.
3- After recording, the video is transferred to a USB storage device if it is mounted.
The script ensures all processes are terminated properly by checking for running processes related to the system script and terminating them. (This feature have a bug and need to be fixed)

##Addressing SSH Connection Loss
If the SSH connection is lost, the bash script will terminate. To solve this, you can run the script in the background using nohup or tmux.

Using this command >>
<nohup ./sys_run.sh &>

#OR

Using this command >>

1- Install TMUX if not installed:
sudo apt-get install tmux -y

2- tmux new-session -d -s my_session './sys_run.sh'

##steps for preparing the system environment
Flash RaspberryPi OS (Bookworm 64-Bit https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/#raspberry-pi-os-64-bit) or Ubuntu (https://ubuntu.com/raspberry-pi)
_______________________________________________________
In raspberrypi 5 you can overclock to 2.7GHz safely with it's active cooler (follow those steps carefully but after the initial 4 steps):
1- sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
2- copy and paste the following lines to the end of this file
arm_freq=2200
gpu_freq=750
over_voltage=6
3- save (ctrl+s , ctrl+x) then reboot (sudo reboot)
_______________________________________________________
You can find initial steps (1,2,3,4) in my tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKhocaaQgyM
1- ssh to raspberrypi 
2- expand file system 
3- make the gpu memory 128
4- make a swap file 8GB (8 x 1024 = 8192) vram (only the steps of swap file from this link https://qengineering.eu/install%20opencv%20on%20raspberry%20pi%205.html)

To create python virtual enviornment using miniconda (https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge)
wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-aarch64.sh
sudo chmod +x Miniforge3-Linux-aarch64.sh
./Miniforge3-Linux-aarch64.sh
>> close then open the terminal again and make sure it is on (base)
conda create -n vtol python=3.9.2
conda activate vtol
_______________________________________________________

install required libraries in vtol environment
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy pynmea2 pyserial

##steps for gps configurations (https://www.instructables.com/Interfacing-GPS-Module-With-Raspberry-Pi/)
Disable Serial Console
Ensure that the serial console is disabled to free up the UART for your script
sudo raspi-config
Navigate to Interfacing Options > Serial:
When prompted, select No for "Would you like a login shell to be accessible over serial?"
Select Yes for "Would you like the serial port hardware to be enabled?"
Reboot the Raspberry Pi.
